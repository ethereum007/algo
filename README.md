# Indian Algo Trading

**Production-quality Python trading strategies for Indian markets — AI-assisted, from backtest to live.**

## Overview

This plugin helps you build algorithmic trading strategies for Indian markets (NSE, BSE, MCX) with best practices baked in. It doesn't ship pre-built strategies — instead, it teaches AI how to help you design safe, realistic, and compliant strategies from scratch.

Covers the full lifecycle: backtesting → optimization → paper trading → live deployment, across equity, F&O, currency derivatives, and MCX commodities.

## Installation

### Claude Code Plugin

```bash
# Register the marketplace (one-time)
claude plugin marketplace add ethereum007/algo

# Install
claude plugin install indian-algo-trading@rupeezy
```

### Standalone Skill

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/ethereum007/algo/releases) and extract:

```bash
unzip indian-algo-trading-*.skill -d ~/.claude/skills/indian-algo-trading/
```

### Local dev / testing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum007/algo.git
claude --plugin-dir ./algo
```

## Usage

Once installed, the skill activates automatically when you ask about:

- Writing a strategy (`"write a moving average crossover for Nifty"`)
- Backtesting (`"backtest this on 2022-2024 data with realistic costs"`)
- Live trading (`"make this strategy production-ready for live deployment"`)
- F&O automation (`"iron condor strategy for weekly expiry"`)
- Risk management (`"add position sizing and daily loss limits"`)

The skill will ask clarifying questions (asset class, live vs backtest, broker, risk tolerance) before generating code.

## What Gets Generated

Every strategy follows a strict separation of concerns:

```
my_strategy/
├── main.py          # Entry point, scheduling, SIGTERM handler
├── strategy.py      # Signal generation only
├── execution.py     # Order placement, fill tracking
├── risk_manager.py  # Position sizing, exposure checks, drawdown limits
├── config.py        # All parameters — no hardcoded values
└── requirements.txt
```

Every strategy includes: stop-losses, margin checks, tick size rounding, IST timezone, structured logging, and graceful shutdown. No exceptions.
